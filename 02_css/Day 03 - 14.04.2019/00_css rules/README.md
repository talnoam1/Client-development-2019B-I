# CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
* The following list of selector types increases by specificity:
    * Type selectors (e.g., h1)
    * Class selectors (e.g., .example)
    * ID selectors (e.g., #example)
* If we have the same selector types twice or more - the last style will override the first styles 
* Inline-style overrides all other styles
* style with `!important` - overrides all other styles
